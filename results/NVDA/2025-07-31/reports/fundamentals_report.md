It seems that there is an issue with retrieving fundamental information for NVIDIA (NVDA) using the provided tools. This problem might be related to the date format or the API endpoint being used. 

Since I am unable to access the necessary data at this moment, I recommend waiting until the tools are functioning again or consulting other financial news services or databases for the fundamental analysis of NVIDIA.

If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different matter, feel free to let me know!
